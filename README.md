/code/ contains many Python scripts to process and analyze the data generated by the various sensors of the Mt. Santis Lightning Research Facility in Switzerland.
These include:
- 24-meter Tower current sensor (Rogowskii coil)
- 82-meter Tower current sensor (Rogowskii coil)
- 82-meter magnetic-field derivative sensor (B-dot, proxy for current derivative)
- Uppsala X-ray detector (NaI scintillator) in the nearby Radome (20 meters from the Tower base)
- near electric field probe in the Radome (20m from the Tower base)
- "far" electric field antenna (flat-plate) in Herisau, Switzerland (14.7 km from the Tower)
- high-speed camera (HSC) on Mt. Kronberg, 5km away
- HSC in Das Hotel, Schwagalp, 2 km away at the base of Mt. Santis (2021 thunderstorm season only)
